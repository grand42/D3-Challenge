# Data Journalism and D3

## Overview

In this project, we were tasked with analyzing health risks for particular demographics, focusing on poverty level compared to obesity of the population. The data set included is based on the 2014 ACS estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml).

## Interactive ScatterPlot

Using the D3.js library, a scatterplot was created which compared the poverty % to the obesity %.  A tooltip was added that allows a user to hover over a data point to display the data.  The graph was then displayed on an html webpage that can be viewed here. [https://grand42.github.io/D3-Challenge/index](https://grand42.github.io/D3-Challenge/index)
